MurmurHud
=========

A mac statusbar hud for launching and closing murmur in terminal. Very simple. Uses MAAttachedWindow class.

Using applescripts to communicate with the terminal app for doing shell scripts. Runs as an NSUIElement application so no dock bar icons to be seen.

Built this because I got tired of pasting the command to launch Murmur Servers into terminal.

Enjoy!
